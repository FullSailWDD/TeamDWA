  "readme": "npm-install-missing\n===================\n\nAn NPM module to reinstall missing dependencies.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AlexCline/npm-install-missing.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AlexCline/npm-install-missing)\n\nI created this module after working on a project where deployments were failing due to missing module dependencies.  An `npm install` would fail to install the required dependencies for an unknown reason and without error.  Since `npm install` succeeds without error, there wasn't a way to tell if the dependency installation failed.\n\nWhen running `npm install` for a second time on a project, npm will check the first level of modules to ensure they're installed, but not traverse the dependency tree to ensure all sub-module dependencies are installed.  You can run `npm outdated` to check if modules are missing but npm won't install them for you.\n\nThis module combines `npm outdated` and `npm install` to install all missing dependencies within the dependency tree.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\nTo be able to use this tool system-wide to install missing dependencies for all your node projects, install it globally.\n\n    npm install -g npm-install-missing\n\n\nUsage\n-----\nWithin your project directory:\n\n    npm-install-missing\n    \nThe script will check the current project directory for missing dependencies and install them automatically.\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\nThis module depends on the following modules:\n\n* async\n* npm\n\n\nTesting\n-------\nTo install the devDependencies and run the test framework:\n\n    cd npm-install-missing\n    npm install\n    npm test\n\n\nSupport\n-------\nPlease file tickets and issues using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AlexCline/npm-install-missing/issues)\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nCopyright 2013 Alex Cline alex.cline@gmail.com\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
